 ## **What is this Project About?**
- This Project is basically a Website which is built for doing `Dependency Analysis` of `c++` projects. <br>
- This website accepts `zip folders` which contains c++ files and `displays the different dependencies` present in those c++ files as different columns in the website. <br>
- This is done by extracting the zip folder and parsing the extracted files in the folder in the backend. <br>
